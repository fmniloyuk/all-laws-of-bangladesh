                <p>(a) A is accused of receiving stolen goods knowing them to be stolen. It is proved that he was in possession of a particular stolen article.
                </p>
                <p>The fact that, at the same time, he was in possession of many other stolen articles is relevant, as tending to show that he knew each and all of the articles of which he was in possession to be stolen.
                </p>
                <p>(b) A is accused of fraudulently delivering to another person a counterfeit coin which, at the time when he delivered it, he knew to be counterfeit.
                </p>
                <p>The fact that, at the time of its delivery, A was possessed of a number of other pieces of counterfeit coin is relevant.
                </p>
                <p>The fact that A had been previously convicted of delivering to another person as genuine a counterfeit coin knowing it to be counterfeit is relevant.
                </p>
                <p>(c) A sues B for damage done by a dog of B's, which B knew to be ferocious.
                </p>
                <p>The facts that the dog had previously bitten X, Y and Z, and that they had made complaints to B, are relevant.
                </p>
                <p>(d) The question is, whether A, the acceptor of a bill of exchange, knew that the name of the payee was fictitious.
                </p>
                <p>The fact that A had accepted other bills drawn in the same manner before they could have been transmitted to him by the payee if the payee had been a real person, is relevant as showing that A knew that the payee was a fictitious person.
                </p>
                <p>(e) A is accused of defaming B by publishing an imputation intended to harm the reputation of B.
                </p>
                <p>The fact of previous publications by A respecting B, showing ill-will on the part of A towards B is relevant, as proving A's intention to harm B's reputation by the particular publication in question.
                </p>
                <p>The facts that there was no previous quarrel between A and B, and that A repeated the matter complained of as he heard it, are relevant, as showing that A did not intend to harm the reputation of B.
                </p>
                <p>(f) A is sued by B for fraudulently representing to B that C was solvent, whereby B, being induced to trust C, who was insolvent, suffered loss.
                </p>
                <p>The fact that at the time when A represented C to be solvent, C was supposed to be solvent by his neighbours and by persons dealing with him, is relevant, as showing that A made the representation in good faith.
                </p>
                <p>(g) A is sued by B for the price of work done by B, upon a house of which A is owner, by the order of C, a contractor.
                </p>
                <p>A's defence is that B's contract was with C.
                </p>
                <p>The fact that A paid C for the work in question is relevant, as proving that A did, in good faith, make over to C the management of the work in question, so that C was in a position to contract with B on C's own account, and not as agent for A.
                </p>
                <p>(h) A is accused of the dishonest misappropriation of property which he had found, and the question is whether, when he appropriated it, he believed in good faith that the real owner could not be found.
                </p>
                <p>The fact that public notice of the loss of the property had been given in the place where A was, is relevant, as showing that A did not in good faith believe that the real owner of the property could not be found.
                </p>
                <p>The fact that A knew, or had reason to believe, that the notice was given fraudulently by C, who had heard of the loss of the property and wished to set up a false claim to it, is relevant, as showing that the fact that A knew of the notice did not disprove A's good faith.
                </p>
                <p>(i) A is charged with shooting at B with intent to kill him. In order to show A's intent the fact of A's having previously shot at B may be proved.
                </p>
                <p>(j) A is charged with sending threatening letters to B. Threatening letters previously sent by A to B may be proved, as showing the intention of the letters.
                </p>
                <p>(k) The question is, whether A has been guilty of cruelty towards B, his wife.
                </p>
                <p>Expressions of their feeling towards each other shortly before or after the alleged cruelty are relevant facts.
                </p>
                <p>(l) The question is, whether A's death was caused by poison.
                </p>
                <p>Statements made by A during his illness as to his symptoms are relevant facts.
                </p>
                <p>(m) The question is, what was the state of A's health at the time an assurance on his life was effected.
                </p>
                <p>Statements made by A as to the state of his health at or near the time in question are relevant facts.
                </p>
                <p>(n) A sues B for negligence in providing him with a carriage for hire not reasonably fit for use, whereby A was injured.
                </p>
                <p>The fact that B's attention was drawn on other occasions to the defect of that particular carriage is relevant.
                </p>
                <p>The fact that B was habitually negligent about the carriages which he let to hire is irrelevant.
                </p>
                <p>(o) A is tried for the murder of B by intentionally shooting him dead.
                </p>
                <p>The fact that A on other occasions shot at B is relevant as showing his intention to shoot B.
                </p>
                <p>The fact that A was in the habit of shooting at people with intent to murder them is irrelevant.
                </p>
                <p>(p) A is tried for a crime.
                </p>
                <p>The fact that he said something indicating an intention to commit that particular crime is irrelevant.
                </p>
                <p>The fact that he said something indicating a general disposition to commit crimes of that class is irrelevant.</p>

                <p>A may prove a statement by B that the deed is genuine, and B may prove a statement by A that the deed is forged; but A cannot prove a statement by himself that the deed is genuine, nor can B prove a statement by himself that the deed is forged.

                <p>Evidence is given to show that the ship was taken out of her proper course.

                <p>A produces a book kept by him in the ordinary course of his business showing observations alleged to have been taken by him from day to day, and indicating that the ship was not taken out of her proper course. A may prove these statements, because they would be admissible between third parties, if he were dead, under section 32, clause (2).
                </p>
                <p>(c) A is accused of a crime committed by him at Chittagong.

                </p>
                <p>The statement in the date of the letter is admissible, because, if A were dead it would be admissible under section 32, clause (2).

                <p>(d) A is accused of receiving stolen goods knowing them to be stolen.

                <p>He offers to prove that he refused to sell them below their value.
                </p>
                <p>A may prove these statements, though they are admissions, because they are explanatory of conduct influenced by facts in issue.

                <p>(e) A is accused of fraudulently having in his possession counterfeit coin which he knew to be counterfeit.

                <p>He offers to prove that he asked a skilful person to examine the coin as he doubted whether it was counterfeit or not, and that that person did examine it and told him it was genuine.

                <p>Explanation.-Documents are said to be in proper custody if they are in the place in which, and under the care of the person with whom, they would naturally be; but no custody is improper if it is proved to have had a legitimate origin, or if the circumstances of the particular case are such as to render such an origin probable.
                </p>
                <p>This explanation applies also to section 81.

                <p>(b) that an accomplice is unworthy of credit, unless he is corroborated in material particulars;

                <p>(d) that a thing or state of things which has been shown to be in existence within a period shorter than that within which such things or states of things usually cease to exist, is still in existence;
                </p>
                <p>(e) that judicial and official acts have been regularly performed;
                </p>

                <p>(g) that evidence which could be and is not produced would, if produced, be unfavourable to the person who withholds it;
                </p>
                <p>(h) that, if a man refuses to answer a question which he is not compelled to answer by law, the answer, if given, would be unfavourable to him;
                </p>
                <p>(i) that when a document creating an obligation is in the hands of the obligor, the obligation has been discharged.
                </p>
                <p>But the Court shall also have regard to such facts as the following, in considering whether such maxims do or do not apply to the particular case before it:–
                </p>
                <p>as to illustration (a) –A shop-keeper has in his till a marked Taka soon after it was stolen, and cannot account for its possession specifically, but is continually receiving Taka in the course of his business:
                </p>
                <p>as to illustration (b)–A, a person of the highest character, is tried for causing a men's death by an act of negligence in arranging certain machinery. B, a person of equally good character, who also took part in the arrangement, describes precisely what was done, and admits and explains the common carelessness of A and himself:
                </p>
                <p>as to illustration (b)–a crime is committed by several persons. A, B and C, three of the criminals, are captured on the spot and kept apart from each other. Each gives an account of the crime implicating D, and the accounts corroborate each other in such a manner as to render previous concert highly improbable:
                </p>
                <p>as to illustration (c)–A, the drawer of a bill of exchange, was a man of business. B, the acceptor, was a young and ignorant person, completely under A's influence:
                </p>
                <p>as to illustration (d)–it is proved that a river ran in a certain course five years ago, but it is known that there have been floods since that time which might change its course:
                </p>
                <p>as to illustration (e)–a judicial act, the regularity of which is in question, was performed under exceptional circumstances:
                </p>
                <p>as to illustration (f)–the question is, whether a letter was received. It is shown to have been posted, but the usual course of the post was interrupted by disturbances:
                </p>
                <p>as to illustration (g)–a man refuses to produce document which would bear on a contract of small importance on which he is sued, but which might also injure the feelings and reputation of his family:
                </p>
                <p>as to illustration (h)–a man refuses to answer a question which he is not compelled by law to answer, but the answer to it might cause loss to him in matters unconnected with the matter in relation to which it is asked:
                </p>
                <p>as to illustration (i)–a bond is in possession of the obligor, but the circumstances of the case are such that he may have stolen it.
