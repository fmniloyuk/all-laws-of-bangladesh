                    proceeding under Chapter XII or Chapter XXXVI of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, makes any
                    order admitting any instrument in evidence as duly stamped or as not requiring a stamp, or upon
                    payment of duty and a penalty under section 35, the Court to which appeals lie from, or references
                    are made by, such first-mentioned Court may, of its own motion or on the application of the Court,
                    take such order into consideration.
                </p>
                <p>(2) If such court, after such consideration, is of opinion that such instrument should not have been
                    admitted in evidence without the payment of duty and penalty under section 35, or without the
                    payment of a higher duty and penalty than those paid, it may record a declaration to that effect,
                    and determine the amount of duty with which such instrument is chargeable, and may require any
                    person in whose possession or power such instrument then is, to produce the same, and may impound
                    the same when produced.
                </p>
                <p>(3) When any declaration has been recorded under sub-section (2), the Court recording the same shall
                    send a copy thereof to the Collector, and, where the instrument to which it relates has been
                    impounded or is otherwise in the possession of such Court, shall also send him such instrument.
                </p>
                <p>(4) The Collector may thereupon, notwithstanding anything contained in the order admitting such
                    instrument in evidence, or in any certificate granted under section 42, or in section 43, prosecute
                    any person for any offence against the Stamp-law which the Collector considers him to have committed
                    in respect of such instrument:
                </p>
                <p>Provided that-

                    according to the determination of such Court, was payable in respect of the instrument under section
                    35, is paid to the Collector, unless he thinks that the offence was committed with an intention of
                    evading payment of the proper duty;
                </p>
                <p>(b) except for the purposes of such prosecution, no declaration made under this section shall affect
                    the validity of any order admitting any instrument in evidence, or of any certificate granted under
