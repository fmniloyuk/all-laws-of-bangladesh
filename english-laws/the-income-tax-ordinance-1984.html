                </p>
                <p>(11) Where any exemption is allowed under this section and in the course of making assessment, the
                    Deputy Commissioner of Taxes is satisfied that any one or more of the conditions specified in this
                    section are not fulfilled or any individual not being a Bangladeshi citizen is employed or allowed
                    to work without prior approval of any competent authority of the Government for this purpose, the
                    exemption shall stand withdrawn for the relevant assessment year and the Deputy Commissioner of

                <p>(3) On the completion of the enquiry, the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes shall record a finding as to
                    whether there has been a partition of the joint family property, and, if there has been such a

                <p>Provided that if, after taking into account the materials available with him, the Deputy Commissioner

                    with the approval of the Commissioner, make an order requiring the person concerned to pay the
                    aggregate of the amounts referred to in sub-section (2)(b) and (c) and shall, if such person pays,
                    or makes satisfactory arrangement for the payment of, such amounts or any part thereof, release the
                    assets seized under section 117 or such part thereof as he may deem fit in the circumstances of the
                    case.

                <p>(4) Where the person concerned fails to pay, or to make satisfactory arrangements for the payment of,

                    he shall be deemed to be an assessee in default in respect of the amount or part, and the Deputy
                    Commissioner of Taxes may retain in his custody the assets seized under section 117 on any part
                    thereof as are in his opinion sufficient for the realisation of the said amount or, as the case may
                    be, of such part thereof as has not been paid.
                </p>
                <p>(5) If the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes is satisfied that the assets seized under section 117 or any
                    part thereof were held by a person for or on behalf of any other person, he may proceed under this
                    section against such other person, and all the provisions of this section shall apply accordingly.
                </p>

                    objection, to the Commissioner for appropriate relief in the matter; and the Commissioner may, after
                    giving the applicant an opportunity of being heard, pass such orders thereon as he may think fit.
