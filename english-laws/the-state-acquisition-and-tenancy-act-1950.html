                </p>
                <p>Explanation.- For the purposes of clause (b), the amount may be calculated at the average rate of tax at which the assessment was made for the last time, before the date of acquisition, under the provisions of the Bengal Agricultural Income-tax Act, 1944.

                <p>(4) The tenants referred to in sub-section (3) shall, in respect of the lands held by them subject to the payment of rents immediately before acquisition, be liable to pay rents in respect of such lands at the rates determined in the record-of-rights finally published under sub-section (3) of section 19, subject to modification under section 53:

                <p>Provided further that when any such rent is shown either at an enhanced or at reduced rate in the record-of-rights finally published under sub-section (3) of section 19 or when any such rent is enhanced or reduced under section 53, the tenant shall be liable to pay the balance or entitled to the adjustment of excess payment against future rent payable by him, as the case may be, with retrospective effect.
                </p>
                <p>(5) The arrears of rent and cesses realisable by a Mutwalli, Shebait or trustee from a tenant under the provision of this section shall be recoverable as a public demand and the Mutwalli, shebait or trustee may apply to the Certificate Officer in the prescribed manner for the recovery of any such arrears under the provisions of the Bengal Public Demands Recovery Act, 1913.
                </p>
                <p>(6) The Mutwalli, Shebait or trustee shall pay to the Government any amount on account of excess payment of rent made by a tenant under sub-section (4) remaining outstanding after adjustment under that sub-section against the rent subsequently payable by him during the period of management by such Mutwalli, Shebait or trustee.
                </p>
                <p>(7) All sums payable by a Mutwalli, Shebait or trustee to the Government under sub-section (3) or sub-section (6) shall be recoverable as a public demand.
                </p>
                <p>(8) The arrears of rent and cesses recovered by the Certificate Officer under sub-section (5) shall be paid to the Mutwalli, Shebait or trustee concerned after deducting therefrom all sums due from him to the Government under sub-section (3) and sub-section (6).
                </p>
                <p>(9) Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this Act or in any other law for the time being in force, in computing the period of limitation for the recovery of any arrears of rent and cesses payable by a tenant under sub-section (4), a period of twenty-four months on and from the date of the acquisition of the rent-receiving interest to which such arrears relate shall be excluded.
                </p>
                <p>(10) Every such Mutwalli, Shebait or trustee shall furnish to the Collector, in such form and at such time as may be prescribed, a statement of accounts of collection of rent and cesses made by him under this section during the preceding year and of expenditure incurred by him out of such collection.
                </p>
                <p>(11) No Court shall entertain any suit or application by any person claiming the benefits of this section in respect of any property or for a declaration that he is entitled to any such benefit, unless such person has applied to the Collector and the Collector has passed a final order declaring that he is not entitled to such benefits:
                </p>
                <p>Provided that, if no such final order is passed by the Collector within a period of 3 months from the date of such application, the Mutwalli, Shebait or trustee, shall be entitled to bring a suit in the Civil Court after the expiry of the said period.</p>

                <p>(2) For the purpose of assisting him in the preparation of a scheme for consolidation of holdings under sub-section (1) in any local area or for the purpose of securing an agreed scheme for consolidation of holdings in respect of any area under sub-section (1a), the Revenue-officer may, subject to such rules as may be made by the Government in this behalf, appoint an Advisory Committee in respect of such area and may provide such Advisory Committee with such technical assistance as he may consider necessary.

                </p>
                <p>(3) In preparing a scheme for the consolidation of holdings under sub-section (1), the Revenue-officer shall have due regard to any proposal with regard to the consolidation which has the largest measure of agreement amongst the parties, affected by it, and in making the redistribution of lands for the purpose of the consolidation, he shall see that the total area of a holding or the profit to be derived therefrom is affected as little as possible.
                </p>
                <p>(4) If in preparing a scheme for the consolidation of holdings under sub-section (1), it appears to the Revenue-officer that the redistribution of lands will result in allotment to any raiyat of any parcel of land of market value lower than the market value of his original parcel of land, the Revenue-officer shall in the scheme provide for the payment of compensation to such raiyat by the raiyat or raiyats who, in the opinion of the Revenue-officer, will be benefited by the allotment of the more valuable land of the first-named raiyat.
                </p>
                <p>(5) In preparing a scheme for the consolidation of holdings under sub-section (1), the Revenue-officer shall, in any case where the land is of such a kind that the productivity of different areas may vary from year to year, give due consideration to this fact and shall attempt to preserve the balanced character of the holdings, as far as possible, and where the plots of land exist at different levels, he may consolidate the holdings in two or more blocks each at a different level.
                </p>
                <p>(6) Before confirming a scheme for the consolidation of holdings in any area under section 121 or section 123, the Revenue-officer shall ascertain, as far as possible, all encumbrances, including mortgages, attached to the land situated within such area and shall issue a notice in the prescribed manner calling upon all beneficiaries of encumbrances to declare their interests within a date to be fixed in that behalf and it shall then be incumbent on the persons, in whose favour such encumbrances have been created, to declare the encumbrances before the Revenue-officer within the period fixed in such notice and if any such person fails to declare such encumbrances within the said period, the encumbrances shall cease to be attached to any part of the land originally encumbered that has not remained with its owner after consolidation.
                </p>
                <p>(7) In preparing a scheme for the consolidation of holdings under sub-section (1), the Revenue-officer shall see that the sum total of the rent of all holdings under the scheme is not reduced by the distribution of the rent consequent on redistribution of the lands.
                </p>
                <p>(8) In conducting any proceedings for the consolidation of holdings in any case where the value of a holding is materially changed, the Revenue-officer shall simultaneously apportion the rent in such a way that the incidence upon the owners of holdings bears the same proportion to the value of each holding as it did before.
                </p>
                <p>(9) Each consolidated holding shall bear one single rent.</p>
