If, after attachment, such land or any portion thereof is found to be situated within any other district or is transferred to another district, the attachment shall continue to be valid but the Collector who attached the land may either transfer the case, in respect of the whole or any portion of the attached land, for disposal to the Collector of any such other district or may himself continue the proceedings under the provisions of this Act.

The Collector may, if he thinks fit, cancel his order of attachment under sub-section (1) or sub-section (1a) in respect of a portion of the attached land and continue proceedings in respect of the remainder of such land.
