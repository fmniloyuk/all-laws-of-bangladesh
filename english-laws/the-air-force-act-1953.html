                    the accused in respect of the same charge and any deposition so taken shall be recorded in evidence

                <p>(6) In the case of a deceased officer or master warrant officer or warrant officer, the surplus, if
                    any, shall be remitted to the prescribed person.
                </p>
                <p>(7) In the case of an officer or master warrant officer or warrant officer who is a deserter, the
                    surplus, if any, shall be forthwith remitted to the prescribed person and shall, on the expiry of
                    three years from the date of this desertion, be forfeited to the State unless the deserter shall in
                    the meantime have surrendered or been apprehended:

                <p>(8) If in any case a doubt or difference arises as to what are the service and other debts in camp or
                    quarters of a deceased officer or deserter or as to the amount payable therefore, the decision of
                    the prescribed person shall be final and shall be binding on all persons for all purposes.

                    exclusion of all authorities and persons whomsoever, have the same rights and powers as if it had
                    taken out representation to the deceased, and any receipt given by the Committee shall have effect
