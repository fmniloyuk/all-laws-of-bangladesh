                    inquired into, and may be allowed or disallowed in whole or in part:

                <p>Provided that any claim preferred or objection made within the period allowed by this sub-section

                <p>(6B) Claims or objections under sub-section (6A) may be preferred or made in the Court by which the
                    order of attachment is issued or, if the claim or objection is in respect of property attached under
                    an order endorsed by a District Magistrate, <span class="correction-highlight">'7'</span>[Chief

                <p>Provided that, if it is preferred or made in the Court of a <span

                </p>
                <p>(6D) Any person whose claim or objection has been disallowed in whole or in part by an order under
                    sub-section (6A) may, within a period of one year from the date of such order, institute a suit to
                    establish the right which he claims in respect of the property in dispute; but subject to the result
                    of such suit, if any, the order shall be conclusive.
                </p>
                <p>(6E) If the proclaimed person appears within the time specified in the proclamation, the Court shall
                    make an order releasing the property from the attachment.
                </p>
                <p>(7) If the proclaimed person does not appear within the time specified in the proclamation, the
                    property under attachment shall be at the disposal of the Government, but it shall not be sold until
                    the expiration of six months from the date of the attachment and until any claim preferred or
                    objection made under sub-section (6A) has been disposed of under that sub-section, unless it is
                    subject to speedy and natural decay, or the Court considers that the sale would be for the benefit
                    of the owner, in either of which cases the Court may cause it to be sold whenever it thinks fit.</p>

                    coin, having known at the time when he became possessed thereof that such coin was counterfeit," the
                    word "fraudulently" being omitted in the charge. Unless it appears that A was in fact misled by this

                    or is set out incorrectly. A defends himself, calls witnesses and gives his own account of the
                    transaction. The Court may infer from this that the omission to set out the manner of the cheating
                    is not material.
                </p>
                <p>(c) A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out in the charge.
                    There were many transactions between A and B, and A had no means of knowing to which of them the
                    charge referred, and offered no defence. The Court may infer from such facts that the omission to
                    set out the manner of the cheating was, in the case, a material error.
                </p>
                <p>(d) A is charged with the murder of Khoda Baksh on the 21st January, 1882. In fact, the murdered
                    person's name was Haidar Baksh, and the date of the murder was the 20th January, 1882. A was never
                    charged with any murder but one, and had heard the inquiry before the Magistrate, which referred
                    exclusively to the case of Haidar Baksh. The Court may infer from these facts that A was not misled,
                    and that the error in the charge was immaterial.
                </p>
                <p>(e) A was charged with murdering Haidar Baksh on the 20th January, 1882, and Khoda Baksh (who tried
                    to arrest him for that murder) on the 21st January, 1882. When charged for the murder of Haider
                    Baksh, he was tried for the murder of Khoda Baksh. The witnesses present in his defence were
                    witnesses in the case of Haider Baksh. The Court may infer from this that A was misled, and that the
                    error was material.</p>

                    upon whose complaint or information the accusation was made is present, call upon him forthwith to
                    show cause why he should not pay compensation to such accused or to each or any of such accused when
                    there are more than one, or, if such person is not present direct the issue of a summons to him to
                    appear and show cause as aforesaid.</p>
                <p>(2) The Magistrate shall record and consider any cause which such complainant or information may show
                    and if he is satisfied that the accusation was false and either frivolous or vexatious may, for
                    reasons to be recorded, direct that compensation to such amount not exceeding <span

                    simple imprisonment for a period not exceeding thirty days.

                <p>(3) A complainant or informant who has been ordered under sub-section (2) by a Magistrate of the

                <p>(4) When an order for payment of compensation to an accused person is made in a case which is subject
                    to appeal under sub-section (3), the compensation shall not be paid to him before the period allowed
                    for the presentation of the appeal has elapsed, or, if any appeal is presented, before the appeal
                    has been decided and, where such order is made in a case which is not so subject to appeal, the
                    compensation shall not be paid before the expiration of one month from the date of the order.

                <p>(d) A is charged before the Court of Session and convicted of the culpable homicide of B. A may not
                    afterwards be tried on the same facts for the murder of B.
                </p>
                <p>(e) A is charged by a Magistrate of the first class with, and convicted by him of voluntarily causing
                    hurt to B. A may not afterwards be tried for voluntarily causing grievous hurt to B on the same
                    facts, unless the case comes within paragraph 3 of the section.
                </p>
                <p>(f) A is charged by a Magistrate of the second class with, and convicted by him of, theft of property
                    from the person of B. A may be subsequently charged with, and tried for robbery on the same facts.
